        <h1 class="text-center"><ins>CHAR DHAM  </h1>
       <P class="text-center"> Uttarakhand, also known as Devbhoomi or the Land of Gods, is home to numerous temples and welcomes devotees all year round. Among the countless religious sites and circuits that devotees visit in Uttarakhand, one of the most prominent is the Char Dham Yatra. This Yatra or pilgrimage is a tour of four holy sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath – nestled high up in the Himalayas. In Hindi, 'char' means four and 'dham' refers to religious destinations.  </P>

       <P class="text-center">The high-altitude shrines remain shut for around six months every year, opening in summers (April or May) and closing with the onset of winter (October or November). It is believed that one should complete the Char Dham Yatra in a clockwise direction. Hence, the pilgrimage starts from Yamunotri, proceeds towards Gangotri, onto Kedarnath, and finally ends at Badrinath. The journey can be completed by road or by air (helicopter services are available). Some devotees even do a Do Dham Yatra or a pilgrimage to two shrines - Kedarnath and Badrinath.   </P>

       <P class="text-center"> The Yamunotri temple, lodged in a narrow gorge close to the source of River Yamuna (the second-most sacred Indian river after River Ganga) in Uttarkashi district, is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. The district of Uttarkashi is also home to Gangotri dedicated to Goddess Ganga, the most sacred of all Indian rivers. Located in the Rudraprayag district lies Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Badrinath, home to the sacred Badrinarayan Temple, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Char Dham Yatra is as divine as it is arduous but fulfills the soul!  </P>

                        <p class=" card-text-center"> Yamunotri is a part of Char Dham (along with Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath), the four most revered Hindu pilgrimages in the Himalayas. The small mountain hamlet, with the Yamunotri Temple at its centre, attracts thousands of devotees every year and is the commencing point of the Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage (May to October), which proceeds from Yamunotri to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath. Lodged in a narrow gorge, close to the source of the Yamuna, the Yamunotri Temple is dedicated to Yamuna, the second-most sacred river after the Ganges. A dip in River Yamuna is said to protect one from untimely death.  Devotees either walk or ride a palanquin or a pony to reach the temple (around 3,233 m above sea level) from Janki Chatti, a steep trek of about 3 km that takes about 3 hours.

The trek of around 7 kms is easy with several halts and you can easily reach Yamunotri at around 1 pm. You can have your lunch at Yamunotri and or head to the temple for prayers. At Yamunotri, devotees pray at Surya Kund, a natural hot water spring named after the Sun God, who is said to be the father of River Yamuna. Pilgrims bathe in the kund, and offer rice and potatoes as offerings to god. Yamunotri is one of the Char Dham sites and is also the first place to visit in the Char Dham Circuit. Thousands of tourists visit the Yamunotri temple of Goddess Yamuna from April to October every year. After your prayers, you can trek back to Janki Chatti and then proceed towards Barkot by road. You can stay at Barkot at night.

                  <p class="card-text">Start around 7 the next morning towards Gangotri. On the way you can halt at GMVN rest-house at Uttarkashi for lunch. Gangotri is around 180 kms from Barkot and it should take you around 6 hours to reach. One of the main religious places among the four Char Dham destinations, Gangotri, situated in Uttarkashi, is closely related to Goddess Ganga. The river Ganga originates from the Gangotri glacier and is known as Bhagirathi. The name Ganga is accorded to the river after it passes through Devprayag and merges into the river Alaknanda. The striking presence of the snow-clad mountains in the vicinity and the pure crystal clear water of the Ganges flowing around add to the sanctity of the place. You will reach Gangotri around 2 pm and you can have lunch at any of the restaurants here. After reaching the hamlet, visit the main Ganga temple. There are several other spiritual sites here and you can spend the evening exploring them. In the evening, enjoy the Ganga aarti, which seems surreal as the flickering lamps reflect on the swiftly flowing river and the chants echo around in the high mountains. There are affordable accommodations run here by Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN). You can stay in Gangotri for the night.
                    
                    
                    The roads here are good and get busy during the Char Dham season. Gangotri is approximately 180 kms away from Barkot and it takes around 6 hours to reach.  </p>

                  <p class="card-text"> he next day, start easily around 5 am for your trek to Bhojbasa, around 14 kms away. In-between after 9 kms you will reach Chirbasa for tea. It will take you around 4 hours to reach your destination. However, remember that a permission from the district forest officer is required for this trek as the route passes through the Gangotri National Park. It can be obtained at Uttarkashi. You have to show your Gaumukh permits at the trek entry check-post and pay the fee, in case you did not pay the same, online. Be careful about the number of plastics you are carrying as you can't leave any behind. The total distance to Gaumukh is around 16 kms and takes about 8 hours at a medium pace. The path, at some places, is quite tricky and the last couple of kilometres is quite challenging. But the major part of the trek is easy with a few steep inclines. On the entire trek you will witness excellent views. You can halt at the camp at Bhojwasa, 4 kms short of Gaumukh. You can camp for the night here. There is also a GMVN accommodation. If you reach Bhojbasa before 2 pm, proceed to Gaumukh. Or, you can start the next day.  </p>

                    From Bhojbasa, Gaumukh is at a 4 kms distance. The trail from Bhojbasa starts from behind the GMVN rest house, where you climb a bit to get to the trail. From here, at most places, the trail is well marked. The path is rocky, and you may have to do boulder hopping at many places. All along, from Gangotri to Gaumukh, the Bhagirathi river flows along. Within a few minutes of crossing Bhojbasa, you will be able to see the grand Shivling peak to your right, and straight ahead, the Bhagirathi group of peaks. The sight of these snow-draped peaks is a life-changing experience. It should take you around 3 hours to reach Gaumukh from Bhojbasa. Once you reach, take in the dramatic landscape. Sit and enjoy the views before starting back. From Bhojbasa, take to the road to drive down to Gangotri and stay the nigh

     <h2> Kharsali</h2>
     <p > A quaint Himalayan village, Kharsali is about 8 km from Yamunotri. Quiet and rustic, Kharsali offers a fine example of rural Uttarakhand with warm and smiling people and wooden and stone houses. Walk around and explore the village at your pace.

        <h1 class="card-title">Saptarshi Kund </h1>
      <p>Located around 10 km from Yamunotri, this glacial lake (at an altitude of 4,421 m) is fed by the Champasar Glacier, and is the actual source of the Yamuna river. While pilgrims offer their prayers at the more accessible Yamunotri temple at the foot of the mountain, the trek from the temple to the lake attracts professional mountaineers. It is an arduous trek but the sight of the emerald blue lake surrounded by frozen glaciers, is stunning. The lake is also said to be the source of the rare lotus Brahma Kamal.  </p>

        <h1 class="card-title"> Hanuman Chatti</h1>
        <p>ocated at the confluence of  Hanuman Ganga and Yamuna rivers, the serene hamlet of Hanuman Chatti is located around 13 km en route Yamunotri Dham. Nestled in the Himalayas and surrounded by dense forests, Hanuman Chatti (at an altitude at 2,400 m) makes for a refreshing stop. While devotees halt here to take the blessings of Lord Hanumana, for trekkers, this is a popular stop on way to Dodi Tal and other destinations.

        <h1 class="card-title">Janki Chatti  </h1>
        <p> A hamlet that comes to life during the Char Dham Yatra season (May to October), Janki Chatti is popular for its natural splendour. It is around 6 km from Yamunotri Dham and is surrounded by high mountains on all sides. Earlier, the starting point of the trek to reach Yamunotri was Hanuman Chatti (around 13 km away), but now a motorable road can take you up to Janki Chatti. GMVN Tourist Rest Housex </p>
